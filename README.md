## gl-utils

This is some useful code ripped straight out from a much hairier project, ported from a wrapper layer that abstracted
over ios, android, jvm and js.  It may be in a slightly borked state, but it compiles.

It contains an `ImageCache` class, which implements a strip-packing algorithm to generate texture atlases, and an
`ImageBlitter` class, which batches up draw calls for rectangular images into a single dynamic vbo.

The ImageBlitter also supports a `Mat2d` affine transform stack, and can intersect (transformed) rectangular clipping
regions via the stencil buffer.
